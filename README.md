## **Problem**
A new client heard about the work we did on ULEMHub and recommended us to this music company, Spotify — they want us to implement their new UI design in TailwindCSS.

They want an exact copy of what the UI/X engineer designed for these 3 screens:

# Home Screen
# Playlist
# Playlist Details

# Sprint 3: Spotify UI/X Presentation Draft


### **Solution statement**
 Break down the main components such as the side bar, footer music player and the colors for the projects for the projects so that it could be consistent with all the rest of the client’s website.




### **Method**


- Jira
- PHPStorm
- git hub.com
- Zoom
- HTML
- Tailwindcss
- Vercel 
- Spotify font
- Icons 

### **Contribution to the solution**
 created the home page screen layout, components such as the side bar menu, main body content which includes the music selections.
